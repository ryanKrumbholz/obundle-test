## oBundle Test

For the given task, I used some basic jquery to manipulate showing the second image upon hover. Then similarly with adding and removing all the items to the cart, I used jquery to show and hide the remove all items buttons based on whether the cart did or did not have any items present. Then used jquery HTTP get, post, and delete methods to interact with the storefront api in regards to the appropriate functions based upon the given task.
